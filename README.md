Everything that comes to my mind to improve or experiment is inside this repository. Maybe one day I will show this to my grandchildren.


I will post here all my codes with my projects. It can turn useful for recruiters, friends, data enthusiasts or anyone who snitches my profile.
If you have any suggestions, I'm super glad to take them unless they are constructive :D
